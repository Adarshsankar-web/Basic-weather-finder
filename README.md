📌 About the Project
This project was developed as part of a JavaScript Bootcamp by LetsUpgrade.
It is a beginner-level project created to understand JavaScript fundamentals and how to work with external APIs.
The application allows users to search for a city and view basic weather details such as temperature, wind speed, and weather description (e.g., mist, clouds, clear sky).
